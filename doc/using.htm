		<h1>Using the Web Interface</h1>
		<h2>General concepts</h2>
		<h3>Overall Event Filter</h3>
		<p>
			All processing done by&nbsp;phpLogCon is relative to a user-selected filter. 
			That is, only events that match the applicable filter condition will be show. 
			In the initial release, the filter condition will be solely time-based. The 
			default filter is "today". Other filters are "the last nn minutes", 
			"the last nn hours", "today", "this week" and "from date ... to date ...". 
      The filter can always be set by following a link on top 
			of each web page.<h3>Page Layout</h3>
		<p>Every page will follow a standard layout. It has three areas
			<ul>
				<li>
				header
				<li>
				main work area
				<li>
					footer</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The <b>header</b> holds the top menu items and the current date and time. It 
			also has quick links to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			MonitorWare's Event Repository
			<li>
			MonitorWare's Event Discussion Groups
			<li>
			a text box with buttons to search Google and Google Groups
			<li>
			... other things may come up during developmen ...
			<li>
				a short description of the current filter as well as a way to change it (in the 
				initial release, a drop down list will do)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When we have the notation of a user inside phpLogCon, this should probably come 
			out of the user profile. Over time, we may also provide dynamic links based on 
			what the user did last.</p>
		<p>The <b>main work area </b>is the primary display/work space. Obviously its 
			content is depending on the called function.</p>
		<p>The <b>footer</b> holds some general information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				copyright notice, credits to authors &amp; links to license</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Homepage</h2>
		<p>The main work area of the home displays statistical information:
			<ul>
				<li>
				number of syslog events
				<li>
				number of event log events
				<li>
					top 5 devices reporting</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Of course, all of this in respect to the current filter.</p>
		<h2>Utility functions</h2>
		<h3>Configuration Page</h3>
		<p>The configuration page allows the user to specify settings important for the 
			overall operation of phpLogCon. So far, it will allow to configure:
			<UL>
				<li>
					connection string for the database (please note that passwords will be stored 
					unencrypted as of now)
					<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">Question:
    any easy way to avoid this?&nbsp;</span></li></UL>
