		<h3><a name="4_1">4.1 General concepts</a></h3>
		<p>phpLogCon is designed to give you fast access to your desired information with a high controllable output/filtering. The whole solution is build for good viewing, fast finding that, what you want and to give you full access to the information.</p>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_2">4.2 Overall Event Filter</a></h3>
		<p>All processing done by phpLogCon is relative to a user-selected filter. That is, only events that match the applicable filter condition will be shown.</p>
		<p>There are two types of filters in phpLogCon:</p>
		<h4>General Filters:</h4>
		<p>These filters can always be set on the Filer Options page. You can reach them through a link on top of each web page. These settings will be saved in the session. So when the session expired, however the filter settings will be default next time. In User Interface mode they will be saved in database for each user. That provides on each logon or opening phpLogCon gettin your personal filter settings.</p>
		<p>General Filters are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Date - The time when the event occurred</li>
			<li>InfoUnits - The Units, where the event had been logged (i.e. EventReporter or SysLog)</li>
			<li>Priority - Filtered by Priority of an event</li>
			<li>Order by - Also you can order the events, in which order they should appear in Events Display</li>
			<li>Refresh - Not that a filter setting, but it can be set in which distance a page should be refreshed. Note that it has effect on all pages!</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Quick Filters:</h4>
		<p>Quick Filters provide the General Filters and can be set in Events Display. They will override the general filters while staying in Events Display. They provide you quick changes for temporally viewing different and little bit fine filtered events, without changing your general filter settings.</p>
		<p>Quick Filters are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Logs per page - How many logs should be displayed per page</li>
			<li>Search for IP/Host - You can filter out one Host or IP</li>
			<li>Message must contain - Searching for an regular expression and color it in specified color</li>
		</ul>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_3">4.3 Page Layout</a></h3>
		<p>Every page will follow a standard layout. It has three areas
			<ul>
				<li>header</li>
				<li>main work area</li>
				<li>footer</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The <b>header</b> holds the top menu items and the current date and time. It also holds:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On enabled user interface, the currently logged in user</li>
			<li>On enabled user interface, a link to logout the user</li>
			<li>When enabled, some debug information about the current database settings</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The <b>main work area</b> is the primary display/work space. Obviously its content is depending on the called function.</p>
		<p>The <b>footer</b> holds some general information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>copyright notice, credits to authors & links to homepage of phpLogCon and Adiscon</li>
		</ul>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_4">4.4 Homepage/Index</a></h3>
		<p>The main work area of the home displays statistical information:
			<ul>
				<li>Number of syslog events</li>
				<li>Number of event log events</li>
				<li>Top 5 devices reporting</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Of course, all of this in respect to the current filter.</p>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_5">4.5 Show Events</a></h3>
		<p>Here you can see the events; listed in respect to the current filter settings. Also you can use the quick filter, that allows you to override (not overwrite!) temporally your current filter settings. This provides a quick view on different filtered events, without going to the filter options. You can also choose how much event's should be displayed per page, color and search for an expression and search for a Host or IP.</p>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_6">4.6 Show SysLogTags</a></h3>
		<p>This page is especially created for watching the different SysLogTags. Here you can see all different SysLogTags, those appear in database with occurrences in database and sample message.</p>
		<p>It brings you two new quick filters to filter and order the SysLogTags for fine-tuning:</p>
		<h4>Display SysLogTags</h4>
		<p>In this drop-down menu you can choose between <b>'Syslog'</b>, that will show you all Syslogs those appear in database with a sample message and <b>'SysLog corresponding to host'</b>, what will show you every SysLogTag that appeared on each Host.</p>
		<h4>Order by</h4>
		<p>You can order the Events ascending or descending by SysLogTag, Occurrences or Hosts, who have send this SysLogTag.</p>
		<p>When you click on the example message, you'll get listed all occurrences of this SysLogTag. They're listed under respect of overall filter settings!</p>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_7">4.7 Details</a></h3>
		<p>You can reach the details through clicking on an events message. This page will give you full information about the selected event. Also you have direct links to the MonitorWare event reference and google groups to get additional information.</p>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_8">4.8 Filter Options</a></h3>
		<p>The filter options allow the user to specify filters important for output of the events. Which overall filters are available is listed above under point 4.2. For optimizing the events display you can choose which quick filter should be displayed. Also there are filters for the SysLogTag page. You can choose how they should be order and corresponding to which field, for example occurrences of one Tag.</p>
		<p>If User Interface is enabled and the option "Save filter settings in database and load them while logging in" is checked, all filter settings will be saved in database. Otherwise, they only will stay like this in current session!</p>
		<p>If User Interface is disabled, the settings will only stay like this in the current session. Next time opening phpLogCon, they will be default.</p>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_9">4.9 User Options</a></h3>
		<p>User options can look in two different versions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>User Interface is enabled</li>
			<li>User Interface is disabled</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When User Interface is enabled, there are more settings than in non User Interface mode. The basic settings that are available in both modes are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Style sheet - You can choose a style sheet you like an gives you best viewing</li>
			<li>Language - Choose your desired language. Currently English and German is available</li>
			<li>Debug - User can switch on/off Debug outputs in the whole script</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The following settings are only available in User Interface mode:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Save filter settings to database - Save filter settings in database and load them on login</li>
			<li>Bookmarks - User can add, delete and visit his favorite/usefully homepages</li>
		</ul>
		<small><a href="#top">[Top]</a></small>
		<h3><a name="4_10">4.10 Refresh</a></h3>
		<p>Simply refresh the page. It's the same as hitting F5 in the most of the browsers.</p>
