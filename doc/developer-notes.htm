		<h1>Developer notes</h1>
		<p>
			phpLogCon is an open source project. Feel free to change what you want. Here 
			you will find some hints and background knowledge about phpLogCon.</p>
		<h2>Gernarel database connection functions</h2>
		<p>The database function in phpLogCon are called similar to well-know commands from 
			e.g. php mysql functions. All database functions beginn with "db_" and 
			then a word that best describes the instruction. Sample: db_connect() - 
			should open a connection to the database. This is according to mysql_connect(). 
			So you know if you find db_fetch_array in phpLogCon for example, that this 
			function should fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric array, or 
			both.</p>
		<H2>ODBC functions</H2>
		<P>phpLogCon support also database connection via ODBC. You can find the functions in 
			db-drv\odbc.php. The most functions are in a very low basic level. The 
			reason, a lot of the php ODBC functions don't work with all 
			versions of php. Also the usability often depends on the ODBC driver.</P>
    <p><b>Known Issues</b><br />At the moment you can only use ODBC for query Microsoft databases like MSSQL, 
    Jet, ... A second database layer which can handle different sql formats should be implement in the future!</p>
		<H2>Include files</H2>
		<H2>include.php</H2>
		<P>This file is very important. There, all other files to 
			include are embedded (e. g. config files and so on). So if you 
			include include.php you have always include automatically all genral "include 
			files". Also you can find useful function in include.php. All functions 
			which should reachable at the whole program, you find there (or there 
			included).</P>
		<P>Note: At each page of phpLogCon, include.php should be included!</P>
