		<h1>
			phpLogCon&nbsp;Setup</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
			For Windows installations, a setup program is included. Please note that the 
			product is also being installed by running either the WinSyslog or MonitorWare 
			Agent Setup programs.
			<li>
			For other environments, there is a zip file containing the full project 
			(including all pages and full documentation)
			<li>
				It is assumed that the MonitorWare database is already existing 
				-&nbsp;phpLogCon will NOT create it</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you intend to use phpLogCon with a non-MonitorWare generated database, you 
			can easily do so. The key point is to make sure that the database contains all 
			necessary data at the right locations. You might want to look up the 
			MonitorWare schema to see what is needed. For syslog events, this should be 
			fairly simple to acomplish as only a limited set of fields is to be provided. 
			If you purchase our low-priced support contract, we will gladly assist you in 
			getting this going ;). Currently, the link to the schema is missing. This is 
			not by intention. If it is missing by the time you read us, contact <a href="mailto:support@adiscon.com">
				support@adiscon.com</a>. The schema is of course provided freely, was just 
			not at hand while writing this...</p>
