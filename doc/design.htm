	<body>
		<h1>Design Goals</h1>
		<p>phpLogCon&nbsp;enables the system administrator to quickly and easily review his 
			central log repository. It provides views typically used on log data. It 
			integrates with web resources for easy analysis of data found in the logs.</p>
		<h2>Main Usage Points</h2>
		<p>phpLogCon&nbsp;is primarily being used for</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			quick overview over current system activity
			<li>
				accessing the log data while not being able to access the admin workstation 
				(e.g. being on the road or roaming through the enterprise)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For in-depth analysis, we recommend using the MonitorWare Console. It provides 
			advanced analysis capabilities not found inside phpLogCon.</p>
		<h2>Portability</h2>
		<p>phpLogCon&nbsp;is being implemented as a set of PHP scripts to ensure 
			portability between different platforms. Target platforms for&nbsp;phpLogCon 
			are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Windows with IIS
			<li>
			Windows with Apache
			<li>
				Linux / *nix with Apache</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The standard set of database systems is supported, that is</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Microsoft SQL Server (via ODBC)
			<li>
			Microsoft Jet (aka Access, via ODBC)
			<li>
				MySQL (via ODBC and via native classes)
				<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">to be determined! Native 
  mysql is recommended for the
    best performance!</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of course, other database systems can most likely be used with&nbsp;phpLogCon - 
			we just can't guarantee that it will work (and we are also unable to reproduce 
			any issues in our lab, thus the need for limitation).&nbsp;</p>
