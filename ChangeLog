Version 2.1.1 (devel), 2008-04-25
- added detailpage into phpLogCon. The detail page shows all possible
  details of a syslog message. It also possible to page in the 
  detail view.
- fixed minor notices bugs in the functions_db.php, which is really used 
  right now. But it will become important once the user-ui will be added.
- fixed "NEXT" button bug in the install script. Infact only ONE next 
  button is available now in the install script. This removes the 
  duplicated ones from before. 
- added full german translation (thanks to Tom Bergfeld for providing it)


Version 2.1.0 (devel), 2008-04-24
- initial release of the rewritten phpLogCon v2
