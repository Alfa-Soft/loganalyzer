- Fixed filter bug, if you want to filter with ":", you can do this by 
  using "\:" now.

  script after installation anymore. It is only possible to use 
  install.php if the config.php is empty or does not exist.

  on PHP4 or lower from now on!

  details of a syslog message. It also possible to page in the 
  detail view.
- fixed minor notices bugs in the functions_db.php, which is really used 
  right now. But it will become important once the user-ui will be added.
