 phpLogCon Installation help
 ----------------------------------

 To install phpLogCon, you will need:

 * Apache or IIS Webserver
 * PHP5 

 Optionally, you may need:

 * MySQL Database

 For obvious reasons, you also need some syslog data. Any standard
 syslogd will do. From a feature and stability point of view, we
 recommend either one of these (which we also wrote ;)):

 - WinSyslog (for Windows Environments - http://www.winsyslog.com)
 - rsyslog (for Linux/Unix Environments - http://www.rsyslog.com)

 Both of them are also capable to writing to a database. Rsyslog is
 a drop-in replacement for stock syslogd and also *is* the stock
 syslogd on some platforms (e.g. Fedora 8 and above).

 Installation in Detail
 ----------------------

  1. Upload all files from the phplogcon/src/ folder to you webserver. 
     The other files are not needed on the webserver. 

  2. If you webserver has write access to the phplogcon folder, 
     you can skip the following step: 
     
         Upload the scripts configure.sh and secure.sh from the 
         contrib folder to your webserver, and set the execution 
         flag to them (chmod +x configure.sh secure.sh). 
         
         Now run ./configure.sh, this will create a blank config.php, 
         and will also set write access to everyone to it.
         
         You can of course do this manually if you want. 

  3. Now open your phplogcon installation in your favourite webbrowser,
     you will see an error, and you will be pointed to the installation 
     script. The install script will guide you through the phplogcon 
     installation, just follow the instructions.
 
  4. If everything went right, you should see syslog messages already 
     in your phplogcon installation. You can now remove the install.php 
     script now. 


Note on Accesing Files
--------------------------------
In most environments the webserver has only access to the web directory.
If you want to read files e.g. from /var/log/ you have to grant
the necessary permisson to your webserver.

Of course, you always need to make sure that the user the web server
runs under also has the correct file permissions. Be careful when doing
this, you may create a security vulnerability by granting too much
to too many users.
 
 
Note on MySQL Databases
--------------------------------
 
phpLogCon does support using a MySQL database as syslog source. 
PhpLogCon supports Adiscon's MonitorWare database schema. The schema
used by php-syslog-ng is also partly supported. That schema, however, is
somewhat inefficient in that it stores facility and severity codes as
textual values. We do not currently convert these values back to their
native format and consequently facility and severity can not be taken
from a php-syslog-ng database.
